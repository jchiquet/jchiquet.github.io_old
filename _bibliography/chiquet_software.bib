                  is an R package which implements the inference of
                  co-expression networks based on partial correlation
                  coefficients from either steady-state or time-course
                  transcriptomic data. Note that with both type of
                  data this package can deal with samples collected in
                  different experimental conditions and therefore not
                  identically distributed. In this particular case,
                  multiple but related graphs are inferred on one
                  simone run.  The underlying statistical tools enter
                  the framework of Gaussian graphical models
                  (GGM). Basically, the algorithm searches for a
                  latent clustering of the network to drive the
                  selection of edges through an adaptive
                  l1-penalization of the model likelihood.},
