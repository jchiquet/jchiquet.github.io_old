                  coefficients from either steady-state or time-course

                  samples collected in different experimental
                  conditions. In this particular case, multiple
                  related graphs are inferred simultaneously.  The
                  underlying statistical tools enter the framework of
                  Gaussian graphical models (GGM). Basically, the
                  algorithm searches for a latent clustering of the
                  network to drive the selection of edges through an
                  adaptive l1-penalization of the model likelihood.},
