I spread most of my code as `R` packages, with underlying routines in
`C/C/++` relying on the great
[Rcpp](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html) package
and the outstanding [armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/) library.

I am also coding a bit of Python to acces tools like Pytorch or
Tensorflow.

The main entry point for my published code is my
[githubpage](https://github.com/jchiquet/).
